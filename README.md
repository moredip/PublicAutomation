# PublicAutomation

PublicAutomation is a wrapper around the private framework used by Apple's UIAutomation tools.

PublicAutomation exposes a nice Objective C API for simulating user interactions (touches, swipes, etc.).

PublicAutomation is very young, but already exposes enough functionality to write test automation scripts for most apps.

PublicAutomation is best used together with a view selection library (like [Shelley](http://github.com/TestingWithFrank/Shelley) or [Igor](http://github.com/dhemery/Igor)) and a nice high-level testing framework (like [Cucumber](http://cukes.info)). You should use [Frank](http://testingwithfrank.com) for that. It ties PublicAutomation and these other tools together for you in a pretty bow.

# Show me code
 
### Tap
```objectivec
[UIAutomationBridge tapView:myView];
// or
[UIAutomationBridge tapView:myView atPoint:CGPointMake(12.0,34.0)];
````

### Swipe
```objectivec
[UIAutomationBridge swipeView:myView inDirection:PADirectionLeft];
````
    
### Type
```objectivec
[UIAutomationBridge tapView:myTextField];
if( [UIAutomationBridge checkForKeyboard] ){
  [UIAutomationBridge typeIntoKeyboard:@"ZOMG I am typing. 123 and $%^ work too!"];
}
````
